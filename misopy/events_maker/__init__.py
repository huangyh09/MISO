# These files are original from Yarden's rnaseqlib package.
# They are used to generate alternative splicing events
# based on input annotation file.

# I changed the import part of most files, and also added a
# function in parseTable.py for gtf input, and modify saving
# part in defineEvents.py for output in order.

# The dependences: gffutils
